# Do Less

Mobile-first, low-admin movement app built from `Planning/coach-app-spec.md`.
It is a standalone browser app: plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, no auth,
no backend, and local browser persistence only.

## Files

- `coach.html` - the Do Less app, served at the site root.
- `coach-state-core.js` - versioned local-state and profile migration rules.
- `coach-prescription-core.js` - upwards-only prescription and completed-load rules.
- `tests/` - dependency-free Node regression tests for persistence and prescriptions.
- `Planning/coach-app-spec.md` - canonical product spec.
- `context/marketing-site-hero-copy.md` - single source of truth for all Do Less marketing copy.
- `assets/` - strong-arm app icons for the browser manifest and iOS home screen.
- `manifest.json` - home-screen/PWA metadata.
- `sw.js` and `version.json` - simple cache/update support for installed PWAs.
- `vercel.json` - static-host rewrites for shared and old links.

## App Features

- 4-question check-in that chooses session mode, time budget, focus, and indoor/outdoor context.
- Quick start with reshuffle.
- Per-exercise countdowns, overtime and PB feedback, plus pause, back, skip, swap, difficulty, and like/dislike controls.
- Upwards-only in-session rep, hold-time, and load controls with the generated target enforced as the minimum.
- Global goal, Profile, Key lifts, Appearance, sport configuration, and the Technique library under Settings.
- Session generator with standard, momentum-reset, travel, and harder-day modes.
- Duration-aware repeat sets, daily variation, environment-aware ordering, and an 8-week progression jump control.
- Completed-only session logs with exact variants, generated and completed prescriptions, load history, and specific technique-video searches.
- Daily streak tracking where any completed session counts, including fallback sessions, with three banked cheat-day freezes that refill one at a time every 30 days (maximum bank: three).
- Evening beer-check prompt and time-of-day behavior.
- Local export/import/reset controls under Settings.

## Local Data

Do Less stores data only in this browser using `localStorage`. Nothing is sent to
a cloud database, no login is required, and data does not sync across devices.

The app stores session history, key lifts, profile fields, theme preference,
optional background signals, and deployed-version state. Browser storage can be
cleared by the user, browser privacy settings, or device cleanup tools.

Profile reload, import, and reset all use the same versioned migration path.
Completed exercise logs store generated and completed reps, seconds, and load;
Key-lift suggestions use those completed values.

Run the local regression suite with:

```sh
node --test tests/*.test.js
```

Use Settings -> Export backup before clearing site data or moving devices. Use
Settings -> Import backup to restore that JSON file in another browser. Use
Settings -> Reset Do Less data to clear local Do Less data in the current browser.

Optional background signals can be written by phone automation to
`localStorage["hwc_signals"]` in this shape:

```json
{"dateISO":"YYYY-MM-DD","steps":1234,"alcoholUnits":0}
```

## Hosting

Do Less is designed for static hosting on Vercel or similar free hosts. Deploy the
folder at the site root. The root path, `/app.html`, and
`/home-workout-planner.html` all rewrite to `/coach.html` so shared links keep
working.

For every deploy-facing change, bump `version.json` and `CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js`
together using a UTC timestamp such as `20260707T105323Z`.
